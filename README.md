# The Megabot

## Introduction

The Megabot is a bot for Discord written by Jeff Cho using the rewrite version of Discord.py for Python 3.7+ compatibility.  Its intended purpose is for use on the Megachannel, but it can easily be forked and used on a variety of servers.

The Megabot is currently in _beta_.

## Issues

The Megabot is currently **open** for issue reporting.  If any bugs or flaws are found, please open an Issue on this repo with the following:

* Descriptive title of issue (`<command> - <unexpected behavior>`)
* Reproduction steps
* Reproduction rate
* Severity

## Contributions

The Megabot is currently **tentatively open** for contributions.  In order to contribute, you must submit a Pull Request (PR) with your changes.  Please familiarize yourself with the [Discord.py rewrite branch](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite) and the [Discord.py API documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/index.html).  

All PRs must be tested and proven before submission (with details of testing/results) and must have at least one code review before they will be considered for merging.  All code must conform to style guidelines (roughly, PEP8 with two-space indents - no tabs) and existing conventions (commands in alphabetical order and with complete docstrings).  PR descriptions must be complete and comprehensive, but terse.

Be advised that the bot is still in refactoring and does not fully conform to its own intended style and conventions, which may affect PRs.
